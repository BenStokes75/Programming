# Student Grade Management In an educational system, a list can be used to store the grades of students in a class. Each element in the list can represent the grade of a particular student. Operations like calculating the average grade, finding the highest or lowest grade, or sorting the grades can be performed using list methods and functions.

class1 = ["Varun", "Babli", "Khushi", "Virender"]
class2 = ["Vishal", "Rohan", "Abhishek", "Harsh", "jigyasu", "anshul"]
class3 = ["Himanshu", "Rahul"]

subjects = ["Maths", "Science", "English", "Sst", "Hindi", "PT"]

Varun = [20, 30, 40, 50, 30, 50]
